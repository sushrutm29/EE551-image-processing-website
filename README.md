# Image Processing Website

This website allows image processing operations to be performed on an image of the users' choice. The supported operations are gaussian filter, sobel filter, non-maximum supression, hessian detection and RANSAC. It provides an easy-to-use interface for the same. More operations are expected to be added soon!

# Core Image Processing Filters
* [Gaussian Filter](http://www.justin-liang.com/tutorials/canny/#gaussian): smooths the uploaded image and removes any noise.
* [Sobel Filter](http://www.justin-liang.com/tutorials/canny/#gradient): processes and displays the edges of the uploaded image.
* [Non-Max suppression](http://www.justin-liang.com/tutorials/canny/#suppression): thins out the edge line generated by the sobel filter.
* [Hessian Filter](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/quadratic-approximations/a/the-hessian): calculates and thresholds each pixelâ€™s determinant then displays the remaining non-zero pixels as the points of interest.
* [RANSAC Filter](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/ransac.html): randomly forms/finds four lines with the most inlier points from the hessian processed image.
